        <h2>Chess</h2><br>
        <p>The game of chess resonates powerfully with my<br>
            perspective on society and life. It is a strong<br>
            and accurate representation of how to strategically<br> 
            persevere and triumph in any cognitive or quantitative<br> 
            challenge. In fact, it can also be attributed to social <br>
            scenarios as well. The game has been a part of my life <br>
            since childhood days, and I have always spent time improving<br> 
            my skills. The game of chess is responsible for many of my <br>
            current attributes and qualities and motivates me to become <br>
            the best version of myself imagineable. To face all problems <br>
            and challenges with a cool and calm mind and to analyze each <br>
            situation accurately. Never falter even during struggle and <br>
            adversity and never grow complacent. Always look to improve <br>
            and stay level-headed while traveling down the instricate <br>
            and arduous path of life.   </p>
